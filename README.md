# rk-dash
Interactive visualization for historical training data imported from Runkeeper

## Setup
It can be tested locally with following command:
```
bokeh serve rk-dashboard-1.py
```

## Demo
https://rk-dash.herokuapp.com

As I use free heroku servcie, it might take about 20 second to wake-up/initialize service and reply to first request.
